# expected-wins

Points scored is a flawed statistic for how good a fantasy team is. Expected wins determines the average number of wins you would get a given week to factor out how lucky (or unlucky) your schedule may be. This site displays both the expected standings and how lucky a team of a public ESPN fantasy football league is. 

This is made possible by the the espn-api (https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api). 

I have performed minimal testing on this and have limited experience with web development, apologies for any bugs.
